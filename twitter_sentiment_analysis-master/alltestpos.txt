Anyone watch #ThisIsUs? Pretty cool show with Mandy Moore and Milo Ventimiglia in it.
Quando Rebecca dice "I’m thankful for my family. I’m thankful we’re all safe. And there’s no one in the whole world..." LE LACRIME #Thisisus
Jack's effort to turn their family's disastrous Thanksgiving into a memorable one 😭 #ThisIsUs
It's a good day to watch #ThisIsUs and #Insecure
The house is quiet, and I am sitting by the fire and watching the latest @NBCThisisUs episode. Yes, it's the perfect morning. #ThisIsUs
It's been a while since we've had a family drama like #thisisus ❤️
@NBCThisisUs was awesome!!! Next week looks like look like a good one too!! #ThisIsUs
I decided to catch #ThisIsUs  on demand and boy am i happy.@NBCThisisUs is such a wonderful show with a very likeable cast.Catch it.!
One of my new favorite shows is #ThisIsUs and our very own @canuck4liberty does awesome ep recaps!!!
I love how everyone on my TL and dash agrees that they wouldn't have let Miguel wear the hat #ThisIsUs
Now i know why they are raving about this show! #thisisus
Spirit of my silence i can hear you. But im afraid to be near you. #ThisIsUs 😍😍😍

I think @MiloVentimiglia's character on #ThisIsUs is probably one of the best dads ever on a tv show.
@ChrissyMetz you are so beautiful and an inspiration. #ThisIsUs is my husband's and my favorite show.
@ChrissyMetz @justinhartley @MiloVentimiglia just saw episode 8 of #ThisIsUs in France  on @canalplusgroupe just amazing 😭😭👌

@TuckerCarlson love your new show, well deserved. Quick ? can anyone find the popular vote button when they vote for POTUS? #TrumpWon. #MAGA
@RoadRunnerI80 nope! HRC won popular vote by a landslide and still counting! She is the people's president! 1 vote=1 vote! #StillWithHer
She won the popular vote https://t.co/uaRbIWimVM  https://t.co/xsQf0x6V8F
@Trump2045896984 @nelsonvelazquez Clinton is ahead over 2 million in popular vote.
@FoxNews @GeraldoRivera @FoxNewsInsider Newsflash: the Democratic Party won the popular vote by a landslide.
@pedos4Muhammad LOL muh popular vote. 😂😂😂
It's amazing that Clinton will still win the popular vote by 2M votes considering what the FBI/KGB and Wikileaks did to lose her the race.
@ADIC33 and... I voted for Gore!  We need to bring back the popular vote!

Might even do better with some USA rightists, as they already contribute a bit more to 3WPT from church collections and teachings.
@PatrickRuffini that's good since there's more lefties than rightists
Leftists love being victims.Rightists love winning.2016-2024 is destined to be a time of massive cultural change for the good.
@haaretzcom fantastic!  Gotta love then"Rightists"

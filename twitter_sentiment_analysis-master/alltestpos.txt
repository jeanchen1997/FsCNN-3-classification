What a nice and heart-warming episode <3 #ThisIsUs #LikeAllRightLetsTalkAboutTheseTwo
@chertex @TheRoyalsOnE that's awesome you met @justinhartley . I really enjoy the show #ThisIsUs
I think @MiloVentimiglia's character on #ThisIsUs is probably one of the best dads ever on a tv show.
@ChrissyMetz you are so beautiful and an inspiration. #ThisIsUs is my husband's and my favorite show.
@ChrissyMetz @justinhartley @MiloVentimiglia just saw episode 8 of #ThisIsUs in France  on @canalplusgroupe just amazing üò≠üò≠üëå

Grayson Allen is good. I think he can pay next level. 2nd round.
We need to start talking more about how Grayson Allen can play point guard in the NBA. Such a terrific and willing passer
I never thought I would say this but Grayson Allen is very close to surpassing JJ Redick as my favorite Blue Devil of all time.
Grayson Allen with five points and a really nice assist over the final 2:40 and Duke leads William & Mary 46-30 at the half.
Cameron Crazie in Duke's halftime contest wearing a No. 3 Duke jersey with "ALLEN" on the back. Hope Grayson's making something off that.
12, 4 and 3 to Grayson Allen at the half. Still not 100% but that‚Äôs a decent first half.
Grayson Allen & Luke Kennard carry this team, But more importantly, they carry eachother. They are the keys to this team.
